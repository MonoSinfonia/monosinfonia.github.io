				so. if you do not know who i am, i am monosinfonia, or koda. 
				<br><br>i'm a non-binary person trying to "make it" in life, but my recent attempts have been god awful to the point where i'm convinced that i am going nowhere in life. 
				<br><br>i tried to make several "mods" for games that nobody plays anymore, i tried to dm for a dungeons & dragons campaign, but im a shitty storyteller and an even shittier dnd player / dm, i tried to make a formal website where i would make a blog about
				things that i like, but as i mentioned i am a shit-tastic writer.
				<br><br>before you start saying "oh boy, here we go again. koda, jasper, zoey, whoever they are is gonna go rant about stupid shit again", note that this is my only outlet. i don't have a therapist, no one in my house would take me seriously, and i lost contact
				with friends.
				<br><br> "friends". i say "friends" as if i have any. i've only been "friends" with fake / manipulative people, or people who lie to themselves. i dont deserve people. clearly. im nothing but an annoying brat who cries about everything in life.
				i have tried to change, but clearly there is <b>something</b> that i possess that makes people want to hate me. maybe its the ugly face? the autism? the fact that im nonbinary? my fat and ugly body? the way i dress? my hair? what is it? why does
				everything hate me? why am <b>i</b> the laughing stock? why do i have to be the unbearable one? who or what cursed me with this?
				<br><br> you know what? it doesn't matter. im writing this to say that i will be taking my own life on December 31, 2025. i will either be homeless, in a mental institute, our in my parent's home, on the verge of being kicked out. i will be doing
				you all a favor. killing myself will ensure that no one will have to be upset at my existance. people can finally stop pretending that they love me, or that they care. i will be gone forever. with a bullet wound to the head. asleep. for eternity. no more
				problems in the world. no more conflicts. the world will be rid of the one thing it collectively despises, koda cook. me.
				<br><br>however, if life actually starts to get better, and stays that way, i will reconsider. until then, look forward to the death of monosinfonia!!
